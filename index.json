In doing so, I design efficient algorithms with mathematical guarantees to render practical deployment of multi-agent systems possible in applications including computer vision, supervised learning, bioinformatics, and dynamical systems (see the Research tab for more details and the Publication tab for a complete list of my papers).\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://abolfazlh.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"I am a Postdoctoral scholar at the Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences at the University of Texas at Austin working with Prof. Inderjit Dhillon, Prof. Rachel Ward, and Prof. Ufuk Topcu.
