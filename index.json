I am also furtunate to collaborate with Prof. Sujay Sanghavi. I received my PhD and MSE degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering department at UT Austin in 2020 and 2016 under supervision of Prof. Haris Vikalo. Before that, I received my BS degree in Electrical Engineering from Sharif University of Technology in 2014.\nResearch Interests The goal of my research is to enhance the performance and capabilities of the networked systems characterized by limited communication budget and data scarcity. In doing so, I design efficient algorithms with mathematical guarantees to render practical deployment of multi-agent systems possible in applications including computer vision, supervised learning, bioinformatics, and dynamical systems (see the Research tab for more details and the Publication tab for a complete list of my papers).\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://abolfazlh.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"I will be joining The School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University as an Assistant Professsor in Fall 2021.
