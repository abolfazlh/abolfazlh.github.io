Previously, I was a Postdoctoral scholar at the Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences at the University of Texas at Austin. I received my PhD and MSE degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering department at UT Austin in 2020 and 2016, and my BS degree in Electrical Engineering from Sharif University of Technology in 2014.\nResearch Interests The goal of my research is to advance the field of Large-Scale Optimization. My group provides actionable insights from the perspective of this foundational field to innovate multiple domains including Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Online Learning, Learning in Games, and Networked/Distributed Decision-Making. In doing so, our group designs efficient algorithms with mathematical guarantees to render practical deployment of learning-based systems possible under a variety of considerations such as limited resources, robustness, and adversarial behaviors. Recent applications include Federated Learning, Medical Image Analysis, NextG Manufacturing, and Cyber-Physical Systems.
